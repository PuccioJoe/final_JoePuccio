    				<p class="lead">Over his National Hockey League career, Alexander Mogilny obtained multiple individual awards capped off with a Stanley Cup in 2000. His career in North America might've never come to fruition without external factors. Alexander Mogilny has been examined for years as the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto admits new members every year. This page takes a look at Mogilny's accomplishments on and off the ice.   </p>

					<h3>Early Life and Defection</h3>
					<p>Alexander Mogilny was a prodigy during his childhood in the Soviet Union. At 17 years old, Mogilny and teammate Sergei Federov were the youngest members in the USSR’s most storied franchise, CSKA Moscow. In the 1988-89 season, Mogilny scored 22 points in 31 games. That 1989 season would be pivotal for Mogilny. He did something no Russian player has done.</p>
					<p>Mogilny was selected 89th overall in the 1988 NHL Draft by the Buffalo Sabres. <strong>There was nothing he wanted more than to play in North America.</strong> Following the 1989 World Junior Championships in Sweden, in which Mogilny and the USSR took home the gold medal, Sabres GM Gerry Meehan successfully removed Mogilny from the team hotel and boarded a plane bound for Buffalo.</p>
					<p>“It took guts to make an unpopular decision and travel to America,” Griffin Della Penna, a hockey communications advisor for the Buffalo Sabres said. “ At the time, the US was a country that didn’t fully embrace people from the USSR. Americans thought everyone from Russia was a spy.”</p>
					<p>Mogilny risked his life to play hockey in North America. His bravery is commended by many in the hockey world.</p>
					<p>"Without Mogilny taking that risk the history of Russian players in the NHL might look completely different than it does today," Mike Johnston of SportsNet writes. "He paved the way for his contemporaries like future Hall of Famers Sergei Fedorov and Pavel Bure. Veterans of the Red Army program such as Viacheslav Fetisov, Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov also left the USSR to join NHL teams, but they only did so after Mogilny’s leap of faith."</p>

        <strong>A League of His Own</strong> - Most know of Alexander Mogilny as the first Russian draftee to play in the National Hockey League. However, it wasn't the only "firsts" of his career. Number 89 was the first Russian and non-North American skater to be named captain when the Sabres gave him the 'C' in November 1993. Mogilny was the first Russian to be named to the NHL All-Star Team. When Mogilny wasn't first, he was second. He became the second Russian player to score 1,000 career points, hitting the mark a few days after Red Wings defenseman Sergei Federov.

					<h3>Welcome to the Show</h3>
					<p>Mogilny arrived in Western New York and immediately made an impact. He scored 43 points in his first season. For the next four years, he would only improve that number. One of the biggest help for Mogilny was his fellow linemate, 2004 Hockey Hall of Fame member Pat LaFontaine. In an interview with SportsNet’s Mike Johnston, LaFontaine said Mogilny was the best player he played with and the best player he ever saw. He said LaFontaine and his teammates would “shake their hands” watching the mind-boggling skill moves and performances from Mogilny. The most mind-boggling stat from Mogilny is a rare stat in hockey history.</p>
					<p>"He scored 76 goals in 77 games", said Della Penna. "That is an insane number. It's completely unheard of and really elevated the Sabres play in the early 90s."</p>
					<p> No player since Mogilny in 1992-93 has matched 76 goals in a season. Ovechkin, Crosby, Kane, McDavid, Matthews, and other dominant goal scorers in the 21st century could only sniff Mogilny's total. What made Mogilny special was year after year, he conitnued to dominate in the scoring department.</p>

					<p> Sergei Federov is the only player on this graph to be inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame. This graph above only shows retired players. There are two active russian skaters, Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin, who have more points than Mogilny. Those two are guaranteed to be enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although those players may have more points than Mogilny, Della Penna says there isn’t a player in the game right now that can match his style of play. </p>

					<p> “He was so fast and craft it’s hard not to compare him to other goal scorers in the league now like [Connor] McDavid or [Auston] Matthews," said Della Penna. "In terms of being underrated I would say maybe Jonathan Huberdeau from the Florida Panthers.” </p>
					<p> Underrated. An adjective placed on Alex Mogilny throughout his career by the hockey world. But, don't just take Della Penna and Johnston's word for it, watch his highlights and interviews for yourself.</p>

					<p>Mogilny was a consistent goal scorer throughout his career, capped off by leading the league in goals in the 92-93 season. Even as a 36 year old, one year out of retirement, Mogilny found a way to score 12 goals with the New Jersey Devils in 34 games played. Mogilny finished with one more game played than Hockey Hall of Famer Paul Kariya. Mike Johnston of SportsNet says Kariya is a great comparison to Mogilny. He says Mogilny and Kariya were both remarkably fast skaters who stayed out of the penalty box. The two accomplished similar feats including winning the Lady Byng Trophy and making multiple All-Star teams. Mogilny finished with better career stats than Kariya and has a Cup ring that Kariya never won.</p>

			<h3>Is the Hockey Hall of Fame in Mogilny's sights?</h3>
			<p>Alexander Mogilny's stats tell a story on the ice not many players can repeat. A bonafide goal scorer, Stanley Cup champion, and gritty player. However, the story of Alexander Mogilny goes further than the ice surface. Mogilny paved the way for Russian players to make their mark in the world's most competitve and skilled league. Without Mogilny, the world would never see the likes of Pavel Datsyuk, Sergei Federov, Evgeni Malkin, Ilya Kovalchuk, and Nikita Kucherov. Most importantly, the game's best goal scorer, Alex Ovechkin, would never get a crack at Wayne Gretzky's scoring record without Mogilny's sacrifice and courage. Mogilny's story off the ice should be known by not only the hockey world, but the sports world in general. His impact on the game of hockey in North America and internationally has been recognized by the Buffalo Sabres by inducting him into the team's Hall of Fame. Della Penna is ready for the Hockey Hall to do the same.</p>
			<p> "It’s a shame that he isn’t in the Hockey Hall of Fame," Della Penna proclaimed. "From stats only he deserve to be in, but adding how he’s a pioneer for playing from Russia that makes it a stronger case. At least he’s in the Sabres Hall of Fame for now!"</p>
